# Corpus Glossariorum Latinorum Online (CGLO)

This repository contains the data for 
[Goetz’s Corpus Glossariorum Latinorum Online](https://publikationen.badw.de/en/cglo/index).

The data consists of G. Goetz et al., *Corpus glossariorum Latinorum* (Leipzig: Teubner, 1888–1923), volumes 6 and 7 (= *Thesaurus glossarum*) in XML and markdown formats. They have been manually corrected from OCR text, in particular the lemmata and Greek words, but many typographic errors remain.

The state of the proofreading and minor textual divergences from the printed volumes are described in CORRIGENDA.md [here] (https://gitlab.lrz.de/badw-data/CGLO/-/blob/main/README.md?ref_type=heads). 
The XML scheme is described in schema-CGLO.xml [here] (https://gitlab.lrz.de/badw-data/CGLO/-/blob/main/schema-CGLO.xml?ref_type=heads).

## Version

The current version is **23-12**. New releases are numbered in [YEAR]-[MONTH] format.

Citations of *CGLO* should be checked against the print *CGL* for accuracy (minor corrigenda are listed [here] (???)). Images of the relevant pages are provided in the CGLO interface.

To cite an entry from the *Thesaurus glossarum* we recommend any of the following conventions:
- *CGLO* s.v. *Abacus* [version 23-12]  # to cite the entry [Abacus] (https://publikationen.badw.de/en/cglo/index#14) explicitly according to *CGLO* data
- *CGL* s.v. *Abacus*  # to cite the same entry according to the printed *CGL* 
- *GLOSS.* s.v. *Abacus*  # the same using *TLL*-style conventions

Note that *CGL* capitalizes the lemmata of all main entries (e.g. *Abacus*) to distinguish from sub-lemmata (e.g. *abaci*) that are only capitalized when proper nouns.
The XML data provides every entry and sub-entry as unique id-tag that can be used for reference as long as the version is explicitly stated. The id-tags will vary from version to version.

Occurrences from individual glossaries, printed in volumes II to V, are typically cited by volume and line number according to the following format:
- *CGL* II 215, 2  # the equivalence *abacus* ἄβαξ found in volume II, page 215, line 2
- *CGL* II.215.2  # the same using dots for spaces and commas
- *GLOSS.* II 215, 2  # the same using *TLL*-style conventions
